Verilog (and **H**ardware **D**escription **L**anguages in general) basics through code examples.

Verilog **IEEE 1364** is one of the most popular *HDL*s. HDL is a language used to model and verify electronic circuits and systems. More on them later.

I think that HDLs lack good-for-start code examples and tutorials with descriptive how-to usage. So I decided to take a risk and make a repository of my experiments with **Verilog**. Do not consider this repository as a first-class place to learn Verilog and don't rely on it. I am certainly not a good maintainer in such unserious non-projects and I can leave it for good in a week or so.
